# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from a publicly available repository.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more. The target variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
